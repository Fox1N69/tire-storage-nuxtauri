# Tire storage CRM

The following technologies were used for the development of this application: nuxt, tauri, tailwind, shadcn-vue, golang-backend. The task was to create a web application for the accounting and storage of tires, but later the client asked to rewrite the web application for desktop, and I decided that it could be wrapped in Tauri. At the moment, everything is still in development and I am not completely sure if it will work fully as I intended, but I will hope for the best.
